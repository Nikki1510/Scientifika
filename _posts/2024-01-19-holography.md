I will discuss holography, the idea that gravitational theories can be described by lower-dimensional degrees of freedom. The most concrete example of this is the AdS/CFT correspondence, which uses ideas from string theory. I will explain how the correspondence works and how researchers have used it both to better understand quantum gravity and to investigate strongly coupled systems in particle and condensed matter physics, where traditional calculation techniques break down.
