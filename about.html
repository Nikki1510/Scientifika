On Friday afternoons, junior researchers in physics and related sciences in Stockholm gather for a traditional event known as the ScientiFika. Hosted by the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (Nordita) and the Oskar Klein Centre (OKC), the events feature informal and interactive talks followed by delicious Swedish pastries. Discussions can range from the presenter's own research to a variety of academic topics, such as the academic publishing system, the impact of colonialism on science, and science communication. The events also include other activities like Ask-a-Professor-Anything, Ask-Each-Other-Anything, and thematic talks.

so far to be much more rewarding than a typical research seminar."

        <p class="card-text ">
Originally from Brazil, he was one of the founders of the ScientiFika. Inspired by lunch talks during his PhD at McGill University which only juniors research could attend while eating pizza, Gui made sure that from the very beginning delicious Fika was served after every talk. Gui mostly worries about foundational questions in physics, and currently does research in quantum gravity by focusing both on the foundations of quantum mechanics and the foundations of gravity. He shares his time between Nordita and the Department of Philosophy, while most of his free time is spent climbing!
